This directory hold implementations of a [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) using two approaches.<br>

- The C++ Implementation selects the midpoint between the minimum index under consideration and the maximum index under consideration. It then decides if the desired value is found or if the middle index is the new minimum or maximum index under consideration

- The Python implementation gets a random index each iteration and determines if that index is the desired value or would be made the maximum or minimum index under consideration
