## Programs

1. **player_stuct.c**: typedef a Player struct that represents a player at a football club. 

2. **quiz.c**: A simple C program that requests the first letter of the user's name and then the users full name. The program then compares the supplied first letter and name and compares to see if it matches. 

3. **wordle.c**: An implementation of the wordle New York Times game where the user guesses which word is a hidden word

## Additional Information

These programs requires CMake and a compatible compiler to be built. I use the [Ninja build system](https://ninja-build.org/).

- Run the ```ninja``` command in the command-line to generate the output/executables

- Run the ```ninja clean``` command to remove the files and executables generated by
